## Roles I'm Qualified for...

### Full Stack Software Engineer

I'm most experienced in full stack software engineering. I have experience with both frontend and backend Using Node.js, Django, and React. I prioritize writing code that is both maintainable and performant. I've deployed apps to AWS and am comfortable with Docker, CICD, and microservice architectures.

### Protocol Engineer

I'm experienced in building distributed systems using C++, Go, and Rust. With a passion for decentralization I would be a solid addition to a protocol engineering team. With a background in blockchain and zero knowledge proofs I can confidently build protocols or private dApps.

## I'm Currently Working on...

### DinkyLinky URL Shortener

A fun project I have been working on is a URL shortener. This shows hands on experience with system design topics, URL redirection, analytics, and deploying applications to the cloud.

You can find the live app [here](#).

You can find the repo [here](#).

### Course CMS

Official name to be released soon, I am building a content management system and learning platform for creators to QUICKLY release courses without the complexity introduced by other course platforms. The backend is being built with Rust (Axum) and the frontend is being built with React.

## Prior Projects

### Air Force Real Time App

Previously I worked in defense contracting building full stack apps for the Air Force. I am comfortable building **secure** and **performant** APIs and services in **Rust**. The application I was in charge of interacted with other services over the network, translating protobuf messages to real time web page updates through websockets. I was the sole developer of the backend service that handled incoming stream data making it easily consumable through an API. All our code was thoroughly documented to meet specifications, with Open API specs and CICD pipeline stages for quality standards and image security scanninng.

I built performant interactive web interfaces using React components and direct drawing in HTML canvas. Application interaction events were all persisted for mission analysis and replay using rrweb.

### Space Pool

I was a cofounder of [Space Pool](http://pool.space), a Chia farming pool with over 30K members. The Space Pool Discord is the go-to community for any talk about the Chia cryptocurrency with 35K+ members. I am a full stack web developer using a variety of languages and tools like **React**, **Node.js**, **typescript**, and **ASP.NET**. I created a full stack cryptocurrency explorer utilizing Chia nodes, Amazon DynamoDB for storage, and Redis for rapid retrieval of coin info. I also built a cryptocurrency price **discord bot written in Python**.

Space Pool was shut down early 2024. Before shutting down, Space Pool was the largest Chia pool using the centralization resistant **official pooling protocol**, and the second largest overall.

## My Skills Include...

### Web Development

I have experience in most major backend languages and frameworks including **Node.js**, **ASP.NET**, **Django**, and **Flask**. For frontend, I know **React**, **Typescript**, and the essentials of **CSS**.

I have a good understanding of Databases (**SQL** and **NoSQL**) and I'm comfortable building an **API**s with authorization and clear Open API specifications. I can create login systems in **React** and deploy everything to production on **AWS** with Docker and CI/CD.

### Collaboration

I am able to build software in a team environment with **GitHub**, branches, and pull requests. This includes open source software such as [this portfolio website](https://github.com/codebreakthrough-com/comdebreakthrough-com.io) built with **Jeckyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Additionally, I have a good understanding of **Markdown** and technical documentation engines such as **Docusaurus** and **GitBook**. I find it very important to build well documented and maintainable software.

I am familiar with Agile and comfortable working in a team environment with other highly motivated engineers.
